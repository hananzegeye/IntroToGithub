Name: Carlo  
Motivation:

  Let's test our first commit.   
  My motivation for creating this class is to learn and master ruby and ruby on rails myself. The goal is always self improvement. If I can   teach a someone else I can teach myself.
  
  I want us to bring out the best in each other and highlight each others qualities. 
  
  My professional goals are to create flexibility for myself in my work so I can start a family and find work life balance. I also hope to   be a team lead soon for our client and help others carry out their goals and open up a door for possibilities to others.
  
  My goal here is to motivate you and have you feel like this career shift is possible for you. Through hard work and definitive purpose it 
  is possible.
